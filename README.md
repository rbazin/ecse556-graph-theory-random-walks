# Machine Learning Analysis of Human Genes Networks

In this repository, we present a comprehensive study exploring the application of various Machine Learning Algorithms to the analysis of human gene networks, specifically focusing on the datasets available on the HumanNet platform. This investigation includes a range of techniques such as Random Walk, Random Walk with Restart, Node Embeddings, and Community Detection, aiming to uncover new insights and methodologies in the analysis of complex biological systems. 

The detailed findings and methodologies are thoroughly documented in `Report.pdf`. 

This project constitutes the second assignment of the ECSE556 course at McGill University.
